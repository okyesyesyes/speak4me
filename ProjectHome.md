Suite of cross-platform text-to-speech tools, with which a computer reads text aloud. The tools have a series of text-to-speech interfaces, including a stand alone interface and a converter to save the speech to an MP3. Other possible added tools include a firefox plug-in, and an online database for customized pronunciations of words.

Students at Learning Disabilities Services will be the first users. Everyone, however, can take advantage of the tools, for example, to create MP3 of a text and listen to it on the road.  The reading software is a critical tool to help students with reading weaknesses. Having the computer read text aloud to students helps them circumvent their difficulty of processing printed text.
